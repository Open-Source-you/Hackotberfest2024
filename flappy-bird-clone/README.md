Flappy Bird Game

Introduction:
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a bird that the player controls by pressing the spacebar or the up arrow key to avoid pipes and earn points.

Getting Started:
To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will start automatically, and you can control the bird's height by pressing the spacebar, up arrow key, or the 'X' key. The objective is to navigate the bird through the openings between the pipes without colliding.

Game Components:
Canvas: The game board is represented using an HTML canvas element with the id "board."
Bird: The player controls a bird with a specified width, height, and initial position. The bird's image is loaded from "./Images/flappybird.png."
Pipes: Pipes are obstacles that the bird must navigate through. The game generates pipes at intervals and moves them from right to left. The top and bottom pipes have images loaded from "./Images/toppipe.png" and "./Images/bottompipe.png," respectively.
Score: The player earns points by successfully passing through the openings between pipes. The current score is displayed in the top left corner of the canvas.

Game Logic:
The game utilizes a simple physics model with gravity to simulate the bird's movement.
Pipes are generated at intervals using the placePipes function, and their positions are updated in the update function.
The game ends if the bird collides with the ground or a pipe. The final score and "GAME OVER" message are displayed on the canvas.

Controls:
Press the spacebar, up arrow key, or 'X' key to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.
Customization
You can customize the game's appearance by modifying the styles in the "style.css" file.
Images for the bird and pipes can be replaced by updating the image sources in the JavaScript code.
