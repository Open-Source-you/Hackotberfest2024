# Simple claculator using C++ #

Hi there!

## General info ##

I wanted to practice my (very basic) C++ skills, hence, made this simple text-based-calculator. It uses switch statements to perform the desired operations.

## Improvements to make ##

1) Make a GUI
2) Must support many other data types and operations

## Installation and usage ##

1) Build the output file:
```
g++ calculator.cpp
```
2) Execute:
```
./calculator.cpp
```
3) Happy learning!
